 * Review API, there are a lot of things I'd like to change
 * PanelDock, PanelDockPostion, are all terrible names
 * Possibly bring IdePanelPosition from Builder into PanelPosition
 * Ability to "iconify" widgets into the dock switcher to "hide"
 * Maximize needs more thinking through
 * Frame header/etc is all pretty bad naming
 * Make save dialog use AdwMessageDialog
 * Drop PanelScaler
 * Rename PanelPaned if we can, it's always been terrible
 * Can theme selector be simplified?
 * Use GSignalGroup and GBindingGroup
 * Fix various DnD issues
 * Use a "GtkStackPage" style object child for panels/etc
