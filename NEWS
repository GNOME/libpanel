libpanel 1.0.alpha1
===================

Another update to libpanel as we progress to GNOME 43.

This includes a lot of action muxer and action group additions to
simplify how we dispatch actions from frames to pages.

libpanel 1.0.alpha
==================

This is my first release of libpanel.

We still expect considerable ABI change before 1.0.0. This snapshot
is an early release so that application such as Builder may be released
as part of the GNOME 43 alpha release.
